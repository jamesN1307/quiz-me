Quiz Me 

This is the project where I create a page to test the user knowledge about the show call POKEMON, 
When user hit the Start button the Red Timer will start counting down from 90s. A series of question will be present to the user to answer with multiple choice if the answer is correct they will earn point but if the user got it wrong 30 second will be deduct from their total time. WHen all the question are answered or the time reach 0 the game is over. User then can enter their initial to submit to the hall of fame which will save their score to local storage. When they want to see their past score they can click on the Hall of Fame located on the left of the screen. The user will also have option to click on go back to restart the quiz or to clear high score which will delete all the saved scores
